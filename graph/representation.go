/*
A graph is a representation of a network structure. There are tons of graph real world examples, the Internet and the social graph being the classic ones.
Itâ€™s basically a set of Nodes connected by Edges, A graph can be represented in mainly two ways. They are:
Adjacency List & Adjacency Matrix.
